# What The Flip

A group project for my Java 2 class, built using JavaFX.  
This is a memory card matching game, flip two cards to find a pair.

## Features
- JavaFX UI with card flipping
- Basic game logic and animations
- High score tracking via file I/O

## How to Run
1. Open in an IDE of your choice (ideally IntelliJ)
2. Make sure JavaFX is set up with VM options:
--module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
